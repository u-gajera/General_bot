The notebook is designed to process and analyze PDF files, enabling users to ask questions about their contents using a language model with a retrieval mechanism. Here's a brief overview:
Key Steps:

    Setup and Dependencies:
        Installs necessary libraries like LangChain, FAISS, PyPDF2, Google Generative AI, and others for PDF processing and language modeling.

    API Key Initialization:
        Prompts users for Groq and Google API keys to authenticate services used for embeddings and chat functionalities.

    File Upload:
        Allows users to upload PDF documents, saving them locally for processing.

    Document Processing:
        Extracts text from PDFs using PyPDFLoader.
        Splits the text into smaller chunks for embedding creation using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
        Generates vector embeddings for the text with FAISS and Google Generative AI embeddings.

    URL Extraction:
        Identifies URLs within the text of the documents for additional referencing.

    Language Model Integration:
        Initializes a ChatGroq instance and sets up a question-answering prompt template.

    Question-Answer Loop:
        Continuously asks the user for questions about the uploaded documents.
        Uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to fetch relevant document contexts and generate responses.
        Includes URLs or references from the documents in the response.

    Output:
        Displays the response, saves it as a PDF file (response.pdf), and provides it for download.
